### Hi there 👋

In the web field, I usually work with PHP. I took place mostly as a fullstack in my positions. I am a person who aims to improve myself, so I like to take part in works that will increase my excitement, to follow technology not only professionally but also as a hobby, and staying open to innovations and up-to-date.
